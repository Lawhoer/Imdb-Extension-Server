# Imdb-Extension-Server
I know you downloaded [Imdb-Inator-Extension](https://github.com/Lawhoer/Imdb-Inator-Extension) to fill a gap in your life, but isn't something missing? It's not working. Yes, yes, you should download and run this file. That way, you'll be complete.

### How to use
- You should download the project and then create a file called ```env.local```.
- You must write ```IMDB_CHROME_EXTENSIN_ID= YOUR EXTENSION ID``` in the ```env.local``` file you created.
- Now, after adding [Imdb-Inator-Extension](https://github.com/Lawhoer/Imdb-Inator-Extension) to Chrome, copy the unique ID that appears at the bottom and paste it into the "YOUR EXTENSION ID" part.
- Yes, now it's ready to use. Go ahead, give it another try.

### REMEMBER!!
- If you downloaded this first, I have some bad news for you; it doesn't make much sense on its own. Go ahead and download [Imdb-Inator-Extension](https://github.com/Lawhoer/Imdb-Inator-Extension) as well.
